Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they’re not enough on their own.  
Railtracks gives them structure, tools, and visibility so you can build agents that actually get things done.  

In this quickstart, you’ll install Railtracks, run your first agent, and visualize its execution — all in a few minutes.

### 1. Installation

```bash title="Install Library"
pip install railtracks
pip install railtracks[cli]
```
!!! note 
    `railtracks[cli]` is optional, but required for the visualization step. 


### 2. Running your Agent

Define an agent with a model and system message, then call it with a prompt:

```python
--8<-- "docs/scripts/quickstart.py:setup"
```

!!! example "Example Output"
    Your exact output will vary depending on the model.
    ``` title="Example Response"
    Hello! I can help you out with a wide range of tasks...
    ``` 

???+ Warning "No API key set?"
    Make sure you are calling a model you have an API key set in your `.env` file. 

    ```txt title=".env"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
    ```

    Railtracks supports many of the most popular model providers. See the [full list](../llm_support/providers.md)

??? tip "Jupyter Notebooks"
    If you’re running this in a Jupyter notebook, remember that notebooks already run inside an event loop. In that case, call `await flow.ainvoke(...)` directly:
   
### 3. Visualize the Run
With Railtracks CLI you can dive deep on your runs. Our observability runs locally from the command line. 

!!! tip "Setup"    

    ```bash title="Install CLI Tool"
    pip install railtracks[cli]
    ```


    ```bash title="Initialize UI and Start"
    railtracks init
    railtracks viz
    ```

    ```bash title="Update the UI given new releases"
    railtracks update
    ```

<div class="rt-video-container">
  <video controls style="width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;">
    <source src="https://railtracksstorage.blob.core.windows.net/railtrackswebsite/videos/Visualizer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</div>

This will open a web interface with all of your agent runs. You can dive deep into each step, see token usage, and more.
